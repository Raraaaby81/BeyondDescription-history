              "Beyond Description" was founded by Kurumi_k921.<br>
              Once, this guild was named "Likers".<br>

              For about one and a half years, only 30 players were in this guild.<br>
              No new members joined for a long time.<br>
              In 2018 January, so many people joined this guild.<br>
              Three month later, there were over 120 players in this guild.<br>
              Guilds were confused by the rapid increase in people.<br>

              <strong>This is the guild's biggest history.</strong><br>
              Without this event, the guild would probably have collapsed....but...collapsed in this event...<br>
              That collapsed event is the betrayal of the guild members.<br>
              In January 2018, a member attempted to destroy this guild.<br>
              His name is Ravenblack_angel.<br>
              He attempted to expel all members with some other members.<br>
              In fact, that happened, the guild had only four people, kurumi and three of the officer ranks (At that time, there were only master, officer, and member ranks for default ranks. We could n't edit them.).<br>
              With this opportunity, I rebuilt the guild from the base.<br>
              At that time, the guild's name was changed to "Hope your dream".<br>
              Thanks to this event, the foundation for the current "Beyond Descripotion" has been completed.<br>

              Then this guild grew fast again.<br>
              See when the guild members joined.<br>
              You can see that many members have joined after May 2018.<br>
              This member is now a member of "BD".<br>
